# Project Title
Pet's eye view motion trails for redesigning open spaces.

## Authors
- Rahul, Bhargava, rhlbhrgv-art

## Description
Motion speaks like the birds and bees.

To generate individual movement motion trails from atop a mobile platfrom, such as a self actuated vacuum robot going about its day, that hint at warm and cool spaces for collaborators, admirers, idlers, casual browsers and hangers-on. This impersonal information is a comment and will provide insight on open plan design. Interpreting such visualizations, may suggest ways to reduce interaction bottlenecks, and allow planning of spaces to encourage purposeful movement.
